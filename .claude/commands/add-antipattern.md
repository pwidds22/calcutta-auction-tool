# Add Anti-Pattern: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions
1. Open `CLAUDE.md`
2. Find the "Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO THESE)" section
3. Add the new anti-pattern under the appropriate category (Server, Auth, Payments, Frontend, or Git)
4. Format as: `- **DON'T** [what not to do] - [why or what to do instead]`
5. Save the file

This is part of the feedback loop - when a mistake is caught, add it here so it doesn't happen again.
