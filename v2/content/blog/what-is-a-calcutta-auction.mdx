## The Bracket Pool's Cooler Cousin

If you've ever filled out a March Madness bracket and thought "this is fun, but I wish there were higher stakes and more strategy," congratulations — you're ready for a Calcutta auction.

A Calcutta auction is a live auction where participants bid real money on teams (or players, or horses) in a sporting event. When your team wins games, you get paid. It combines the thrill of fantasy sports, the strategy of investing, and the energy of a live auction into one event.

## How It Works

Here's the basic flow:

1. **Everyone gathers** — online or in person
2. **Teams go up for auction** — one at a time, just like a real auction
3. **Participants bid** — highest bidder "owns" that team
4. **All money goes into a pot** — the total of all winning bids
5. **The pot pays out** — based on how teams perform in the tournament

For example, in a March Madness Calcutta, the pot might pay out a percentage for each round a team advances. If you bought Duke for $200 and they make it to the Final Four, you could collect payouts for each round they survived.

## Why Calcuttas Are Better Than Brackets

**Skill matters more.** Anyone can get lucky with a bracket. In a Calcutta, you need to evaluate which teams are undervalued, set a budget, and make real-time bidding decisions.

**Every game matters.** With a bracket, one upset and you're done. In a Calcutta, every team you own can earn payouts at every round.

**The auction itself is an event.** The live bidding creates unforgettable moments — rivalries, bluffs, overpays that everyone remembers for years.

**Flexible payouts.** The commissioner sets how the pot is distributed across rounds. Top-heavy payouts reward going deep. Balanced payouts reward volume.

## Payout Structure Example

A typical March Madness Calcutta might split the pot like this:

| Round | Payout |
|-------|--------|
| Round of 32 | 5% |
| Sweet 16 | 10% |
| Elite 8 | 15% |
| Final Four | 20% |
| Championship Game | 20% |
| Winner | 30% |

So if the total pot is $10,000 and you own a team that wins the championship, you'd collect payouts at every round — potentially thousands of dollars.

## What Sports Work for Calcuttas?

Calcutta auctions work for almost any tournament-style event:

- **March Madness** — the classic, 64 teams
- **Golf majors** — bid on individual golfers at The Masters, US Open, etc.
- **NFL Playoffs** — 14 teams, high stakes
- **Horse racing** — the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, Belmont
- **FIFA World Cup** — 32+ national teams
- **College Football Playoff** — expanding format means more teams to bid on

If it has a bracket or a field, you can run a Calcutta on it.

## How to Get Started

The hardest part of running a Calcutta used to be the logistics — tracking bids, calculating payouts, and settling up afterward. That's exactly what Calcutta Edge handles for you.

1. **Create a free account** and set up your auction
2. **Invite participants** with a simple join code
3. **Run the live auction** with real-time bidding
4. **Track results** as games happen
5. **Settle up** with automated payout calculations

Whether you're running your first Calcutta or your twentieth, the platform handles the complexity so you can focus on the fun.

## Tips for First-Timers

- **Set a budget before the auction starts.** It's easy to get caught up in bidding wars.
- **Don't chase favorites.** The best value is often in the mid-tier teams that nobody's excited about.
- **Watch the pot size.** As more money flows in, the payouts get larger — which changes what teams are "worth."
- **Have fun.** The auction night itself is half the experience.

Ready to host your first Calcutta? It's free to set up, and you can run it for any sport, any tournament, any size group.
