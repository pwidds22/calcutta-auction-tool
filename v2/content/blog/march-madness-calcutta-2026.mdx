## March Madness 2026 Is Coming

Selection Sunday is March 15th. The first games tip off March 17th. That means Calcutta auction season is officially here.

Whether you've been running a March Madness Calcutta for years or you're organizing one for the first time, this year you have a better option than spreadsheets and group texts.

## What's New on Calcutta Edge

We built Calcutta Edge specifically for groups like yours. Here's what's included — all for free:

### Free Live Auction Hosting

- **Real-time bidding** — everyone sees bids as they happen
- **One-click setup** — create your auction, share a join code, go
- **Commissioner controls** — manage the auction flow, pause, skip, undo
- **Auto-timer** — configurable countdown with bid-extension resets
- **Works on any device** — phone, tablet, laptop

No app to download. No account fees. Just create an auction and invite your group.

### Strategy Analytics ($29.99)

For the competitive edge:

- **Devigged odds** for all 64 teams based on current sportsbook lines
- **Fair value calculations** adjusted for your pool's payout structure
- **Suggested bid limits** so you never overpay
- **Round-by-round profit projections** for every team
- **Live strategy overlay** — see fair values during the auction in real time

The strategy tool is optional. Free hosting works perfectly without it.

### Post-Auction Settlement

After the tournament, track results as games happen:

- **Live leaderboard** — see who's winning in real time
- **Automatic payout calculations** based on actual results
- **Settlement matrix** — who owes whom, minimized transactions
- **Export everything** — CSV, text summaries, copy-paste ready

## How to Set Up Your 2026 Calcutta

**Step 1: Create your account** (free, takes 30 seconds)

**Step 2: Create your auction session** — pick March Madness 2026, set your payout rules, configure the timer and bid increments

**Step 3: Share the join code** — send a 6-character code to your group via text, email, or group chat

**Step 4: Run the auction** — open the commissioner panel on Selection Sunday (or whenever your group meets) and start auctioning teams

**Step 5: Track results** — as games are played, enter results and watch the leaderboard update

That's it. No spreadsheets. No arguments about who bought what. No manual payout math.

## Payout Presets

Not sure how to structure payouts? We include three research-based presets:

- **Balanced** — rewards depth and breadth equally
- **Top Heavy** — big payouts for deep runs and the championship
- **With Props** — includes side bets for things like biggest upset or most points

Or build your own custom payout structure — any split that adds up to 100%.

## Beyond March Madness

After the tournament, your Calcutta Edge account works for any sporting event. We have tournament configs ready for:

- **The Masters** — bid on individual golfers
- **NFL Playoffs** — 14 teams, big stakes
- **Kentucky Derby** — classic Calcutta format
- **And more** — any tournament-style event

One platform for every Calcutta your group runs throughout the year.
