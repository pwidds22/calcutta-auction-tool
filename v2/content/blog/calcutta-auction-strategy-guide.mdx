## Most People Lose Calcutta Auctions. Here's Why.

The average Calcutta participant bids based on gut feeling. They overpay for favorites, ignore mid-tier value, and blow their budget in the first 15 minutes. The result? They leave money on the table — literally.

The profitable approach is mathematical. Every team has a calculable fair value based on their odds of advancing through each round and the payout structure. If you buy a team below its fair value, you have an edge. If you consistently buy below fair value, you win over time.

## The Core Concept: Fair Value

A team's fair value in a Calcutta is based on two things:

1. **Their probability of advancing** through each round
2. **What each round pays out** from the pot

Here's the formula in plain English:

> **Fair Value = (Chance of R32 win × R32 payout) + (Chance of S16 win × S16 payout) + ... for each round**

If a team has a 50% chance of winning their first game and the pot pays 5% for that round, that first-round contribution is worth 2.5% of the pot. Add up all the rounds, multiply by the pot size, and you get the team's fair value in dollars.

## Where the Odds Come From

The best odds to use are sportsbook lines — specifically, futures odds for how far each team will advance. But raw sportsbook odds include a built-in margin (called the "vig" or "juice") that makes them add up to more than 100%.

To get accurate probabilities, you need to **devig** the odds — remove the sportsbook's margin so the probabilities sum to exactly 100% at each decision point.

This is one of the hardest parts to do manually, which is why we built it into the strategy tool. The devigging is structure-aware: for March Madness, it accounts for the bracket (a 1-seed can only play a 16-seed in Round 1), while for golf, it uses a global field approach.

## Bankroll Management

Knowing fair values is only half the battle. You also need a bidding strategy:

**The 95% Rule.** A good default is to bid up to 95% of fair value. This gives you a 5% edge on every purchase while still being competitive enough to win auctions.

**Budget allocation.** Don't spend all your money on one team. A portfolio approach is better — own 3-5 teams across different value tiers. One upset doesn't wipe you out, and you have more chances to hit.

**Early vs. late auction dynamics.** Early in the auction, people overbid because excitement is high and they haven't spent anything yet. Late in the auction, fatigue sets in and prices often drop below fair value. If you can be patient, there's value in waiting.

## The Projected Pot Trick

One of the most powerful edges in a Calcutta is understanding the projected pot size.

Before the auction, you estimate the pot (maybe $5,000 based on how many people are playing). But as bids come in, you can calculate the *actual* projected pot based on how much has already been spent versus how much value has been sold.

If early teams are selling above fair value, the projected pot is growing — which means remaining teams are worth more than you initially calculated. The smart bidder adjusts in real time.

## Common Mistakes

**Overpaying for the #1 seed.** Everyone wants them, so the auction price is almost always above fair value. Let someone else make that mistake.

**Ignoring the payout structure.** A team that can win one game in a top-heavy payout structure is nearly worthless. The same team in a balanced payout structure has real value. Always factor in the rules.

**Bidding wars.** When two people want the same team, the price spirals above fair value fast. Know your limit and walk away. There's always another team.

**Not tracking your budget.** It's easy to spend more than planned in the heat of the moment. Write down your limit before the auction starts and stick to it.

## Putting It Together

The winning formula for Calcuttas:

1. **Calculate fair values** for every team before the auction
2. **Set bid limits** at 90-95% of fair value
3. **Track the pot** in real time and adjust
4. **Build a portfolio** across value tiers
5. **Stay disciplined** when the room gets emotional

This is exactly what our strategy analytics tool computes for you — devigged odds, fair values, suggested bids, and round-by-round profit projections. It even overlays during the live auction so you can see your edge in real time.

The math doesn't guarantee you'll win every Calcutta. But it guarantees you'll make better decisions than the people bidding on vibes.
