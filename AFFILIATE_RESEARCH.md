# Sportsbook Affiliate Research

## How It Works
1. You place a link on your site with a unique tracking ID (e.g., "Check March Madness odds on DraftKings")
2. User clicks -> lands on sportsbook -> creates account + deposits
3. You earn CPA (flat fee per new depositor) or revenue share (% of net gaming revenue)
4. Tracking via cookie (30-90 day window) + referral code in URL
5. Payment: typically 30 days after month-end

## Why Calcutta Users Would Click
- Already thinking about odds and team values
- Comfortable with financial stakes on sports
- Natural placement: "Use sportsbook odds to find undervalued teams in your auction"
- Self-selecting affluent, analytically-minded audience

## CPA Rates
| Program | Sportsbook CPA | DFS CPA |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| DraftKings | $100-300 (hard to get approved) | $40-100 |
| FanDuel | $100-400 (easier approval) | $25-100 |
| BetMGM | Comparable to above | Similar |

## Getting Approved
- **FanDuel**: Apply first — easier approval, accepts smaller sites with relevant content
- **DraftKings**: Selective — asks how many FTDs you can drive per month, may reject small sites
- **Requirements**: Active website with sports/gambling content, 21+, licensed jurisdiction, W-9 tax docs

## State Licensing Warning
Several states require affiliate licenses BEFORE promoting sportsbooks:
- Arizona: $1,500 initial + $500 renewal
- Colorado: $350-500
- New Jersey: $0 (basic) to $2,000 (revenue share)
- Pennsylvania: $500 app + $2,500 registration
- Also: Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee, West Virginia

**DFS promotion avoids this** — DFS classified differently from sports betting in most states.

## Realistic Numbers for CalcuttaEdge
At 5,000 March Madness visitors:
- ~300 clicks on sportsbook link (6%)
- ~60 registrations (20% of clicks)
- ~20 first-time depositors (many already have accounts)
- 20 x $150 CPA = **$3,000 best case**
- Pessimistic first year: 5-10 conversions = **$750-1,500**

## Recommended Approach
1. Apply to FanDuel Partners first
2. Start with DFS promotion (no state licensing complexity)
3. Place links contextually in strategy content (not as ads)
4. Track conversions for one March Madness season
5. Evaluate sportsbook CPA + licensing costs based on actual traffic data
